# Snake
A basic, bare-bones, minimal effort implementation of [snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)).

## Features
- Graphics (neat)
- Keyboard controls (outstanding)
- Game over screen (fantastic)

## How do I run this?
[Zig](https://ziglang.org/download) compiler version 0.11.0 is required (0.12.0-dev.280* seems to work as well).

Clone the repository, compile & run:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/IvyTheIV/snake.git && cd snake
zig build run -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall
```
